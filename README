This is an older version of MOOSE taken from svn snapshot on
2013-10-26 from the sourceforge repository.

The single-column thalamocortical model by Traub et al 2005 was ported
and enhanced on this version of MOOSE using its Python interface. The
entire simulation code is available here:
http://github.com/BhallaLab/thalamocortical.

Building
=========

To build this version, you need:

g++

make

flex

bison

swig

readline library

GNU Scientific Library (GSL) with cblas support (libgslcblas-dev)

Python 2.7 development libraries 

installed. The default location of Python header (Python.h) is
/usr/include/python2.7 and if you have it in another location, please
change the entry

-I/usr/include/python2.7 

in pymoose/Makefile to

-I{path_to_location_of_Python.h}

You may need to edit the main Makefile similarly if you have
non-standard location for GSL headers.


To build, run:

make pymoose

in this directory. This will generate python/moose/_moose.so and
python/moose/moose.py. Add the python directory in your PYTHONPATH
environment variable:

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:{moose-thalamocortical}/python
